## Overview
This is a simple expense tracker built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It allows users to input their expenses and keep track of them.

## Features
- Add new expenses with a title and amount.
- View a list of all added expenses.
- Delete expenses from the list.

## How to Use
1. Enter the title of your expense in the 'Title' field.
2. Enter the amount of your expense in the 'Amount' field.
3. Click 'Add Entry' to add the expense to the list.
4. To delete an expense, click the 'Delete' button next to the expense you want to remove.

## Code Structure
The project is structured into two main sections: the HTML structure and the CSS styling.

### HTML
The HTML structure includes a form for inputting expenses and a list for displaying them. Each expense item in the list includes a title, an amount, and a delete button.

### CSS
The CSS provides the styling for the page, including colors, fonts, and animations. The animations create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Future Improvements
- Add a feature to edit existing expenses.
- Implement local storage to persist data across sessions.
